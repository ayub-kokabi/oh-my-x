Privacy Policy for Oh My X Extension

Last Updated: 2025-08-30

This Privacy Policy describes how the Oh My X browser extension ("we," "us," or "our") handles information. Our commitment is to your privacy, and this extension is designed to be simple, secure, and respectful of your data.

**Data We Do NOT Collect**

Oh My X is a client-side-only extension. We do not collect, store, track, or transmit any personal information or browsing data. All functionality occurs locally on your computer.

**Data Storage (User Settings)**

To function correctly, the extension needs to save your preferences. This data is stored locally on your computer using the browser's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data includes:

1.  The list of languages you have selected to allow.
2.  Your preference for hiding posts without text.
3.  The list of usernames you have added to the exclusion list.

This data is synced to your own browser profile but is **never** accessed by the developer or sent to any external server.

**Data Usage (Website Content)**

The extension's content script runs only on `twitter.com` and `x.com`. To perform its filtering function, the script must read the content of the webpage in real-time. This includes:

- Reading the language attribute of posts.
- Reading the usernames associated with posts to check against your exclusion list.

This information is processed **locally and immediately** to decide whether to hide a post. It is **never** stored, saved, or transmitted off your computer.

**Third-Party Services**

The extension does not use any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or data processing.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
